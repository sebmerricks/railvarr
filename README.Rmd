## Getting Started

The first step is to massge your raw data into the correct structure, as railvarr provides no reading functionality.

### Centrix

A detailed overview of what is expected for Centrix data can be found in [wrangle_centrix()](https://sebmerricks.github.io/railvarr/reference/wrangle_centrix.html). Here is an example of a valid Centrix data frame:
```{r raw_centrix}
data(raw_centrix)
raw_centrix
```

```{r raw_timetable}
data(timetable)
timetable
```
