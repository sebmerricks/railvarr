The goal of `railvarr` is to provide a functional and flexible processing pipeline for Centrix data to allow you to quickly get started with analysis.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `railvarr` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sebmerricks/railvarr")
```

## Pipeline

`railvarr` implements 5 key processing steps for the analysis of Centrix data.

### 1. Centrix Processing

In this step, the raw Centrix data are converted into human-readable berth-level observations, including labeling train IDs. This step also removes anomalies and invalid data. Up to around 5% of the data can be lost. The main function you will need for this step is [wrangle_centrix()](https://sebmerricks.github.io/railvarr/reference/wrangle_centrix.html). For more information about the structure of Centrix data, see the [Get Started page](https://sebmerricks.github.io/railvarr/articles/railvarr.html#centrix).

### 2. Centrix Clustering

Raw Centrix data contain no information about train types or stopping patterns. However, knowledge of these patterns is useful for analysis and is a pre-requisite to the ID matching process. Therefore, `railvarr` provides functionality for clustering Centrix data by travel time. Specifically, K-Means Clustering is used. Manual outlier detection is currently required, although we aim to include outlier detection functionality in future versions. See the [Get Started page](https://sebmerricks.github.io/railvarr/articles/railvarr.html#clustering) and [function documentation](https://sebmerricks.github.io/railvarr/reference/cluster_journeys.html) for more information.

### 3. Timetable Processing

This step filters the timetable to only include relevant services, travelling in the correct direction. It also calculates and attaches calling patterns. The main `railvarr` function you will need for this is [wrangle_timetable()](https://sebmerricks.github.io/railvarr/reference/wrangle_timetable.html).

### 4. ID Matching

The ID matching algorithm matches Centrix IDs with corresponding timetable IDs. This is necessary because raw Centrix data contain no identification information. Furthermore, there can be mismatches, where Centrix says there are trains present when the timetable doesn't, and vice-versa. An extra input is required here, containing instructions for the matching process. For more details, see [match_ids()](https://sebmerricks.github.io/railvarr/reference/match_ids.html) and the [ID Matching section of the Get Started page](https://sebmerricks.github.io/railvarr/articles/railvarr.html#id-matching).

### 5. Dwell Time and Delays

Before calculating dwell times, you need to know the length of each berth. This could come from a data source, but we have found that such data is not always reliable. Therefore, `railvarr` provides functionality for estimating berth lengths. This can be done using the [estimate_berth_lengths()](https://sebmerricks.github.io/railvarr/reference/estimate_berth_lengths.html) function. This function first requires running the processed timetable through the [calculate_journey_specifications()](https://sebmerricks.github.io/railvarr/reference/calculate_journey_specifications.html). Once you are in possession of berth lengths, you can calculate dwell times using the [estimate_dwell_times()](https://sebmerricks.github.io/railvarr/reference/estimate_dwell_times.html) function. For more details, see the [dwell times section of the Get Started page](https://sebmerricks.github.io/railvarr/articles/railvarr.html#dwell-times-1). Once you have dwell times, you can then [estimate delays](https://sebmerricks.github.io/railvarr/articles/railvarr.html#delays)

# Example Data

`railvarr` comes with some example data to help you get started. The documentation for each function will contain a link to the relevant data sets. These example data are also used in the function examples.
