\title{Set Asset Mapping with Validation}
\usage{
set_asset_mapping(new_asset_mapping)
}
\arguments{
\item{new_asset_mapping}{A list representing the asset mapping containing
information about assets, signals, berths, tracks, events, and geographic
information. The input mapping must adhere to the expected format and
validation rules.}
}
\description{
This function allows you to set the asset mapping in the current environment
after validating the format of the provided mapping. The asset mapping is
stored in the environment variable 'asset_mapping'.
}
\details{
This function performs strict validation on the input
\code{new_asset_mapping} using predefined rules. The function checks if the
provided mapping adheres to the expected format and throws an error if any
of the validation rules are violated. The validation rules ensure that each
component of the mapping is in the correct format and data type.

The input \code{new_asset_mapping} must be a data frame with the following
elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{signal}: A character vector representing the signal ID in the
format "S\code{[}0-9\verb{]}+" (e.g., "S123").
\item \code{berth}: A character vector representing the berth information.
\item \code{track}: A character vector representing the track ID in the
format "T\code{[}A-Z\verb{]}+(-\code{[}0-9\verb{]}{1})?" (e.g., "TA-1").
\item \code{event}: A character vector representing the event type, which
must be either "enters" or "vacates".
\item \code{geo}: A character vector representing the geographic
information.
}

Use \link{get_asset_mapping} to retrieve the asset mapping
once set.
