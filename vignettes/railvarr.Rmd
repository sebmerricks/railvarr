# Introduction

This vignette will guide you through the `railvarr` processing pipeline from
start to finish. It is assumed that you are already in possession of Centrix
and timetable data.

`railvarr` provides no functionality for reading raw data. Instead, you should
massage your data to match the description of `raw_centrix` in 
`wrangle_centrix()` and of `timetable` in `wrangle_timetable()`.

# Centrix

## Overview

Railway tracks are separated into distinct blocks, called berths. These berths
are protected by signals. In this example, there is a train in berth D and the
signals are using a [4-aspect system](https://safety.networkrail.co.uk/jargon-buster/four-aspect-signal/).

```{r out.width = '100%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/berth-diagram.png")
```

Each berth is made up of one or more track sections, which are fitted with [track circuits](https://www.networkrail.co.uk/stories/track-circuits-explained/). 
These track circuits detect the presence or absence of trains, triggering 
changes in the signalling system.

Centrix data comes from the state transitions caused by train movements, 
detected by track circuits.

```{r out.width = '100%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/centrix-example.png")
```

Note that there is a small offset between the train entering a berth and the 
signal changing to red. There is also an offset between the train vacating the 
berth and the signal changing to yellow.

The Centrix observations derived from these events would be as follows:
```{r echo = FALSE}
dplyr::tribble(
  ~asset, ~dt, ~transition,
  "D TR", 0, "UP to DN",
  "S1 DGE", 1, "UP to DN",
  "S1 RGE", 1, "DN to UP",
  "E TR", 40, "UP to DN",
  "D TR", 50, "DN to UP",
  "S1 RGE", 55, "UP to DN",
  "S1 HGE", 55, "DN to UP"
)
```

The track (denoted by a `" TR"` suffix on the asset ID) transitions come from 
the track circuits. Therefore, `"UP to DN"` denotes a train entering the track,
while `"DN to UP"` denotes a train vacating the track.

Signal transitions are different, with `"UP to DN"` representing a change FROM a
state, while `"DN to UP"` represents a change TO a state. Therefore, the second
observation says that signal `S1` changed off of green (`DGE`) at time `1`. The
third observation correspondingly says that signal `S1` changed to red (`RGE`) 
at time `1`. The signal state (which corresponds to its aspect) is embedded as a
suffix to the asset ID.

## Processing

`railvarr` provides a number of functions to facilitate the processing of 
Centrix data. These functions are wrapped by the function `wrangle_centrix()`.
See the specific function documentation for more details.

`wrangle_centrix()` requires raw Centrix data as described in the previous 
section, as well as a map of the track sections of interest. This map specifies 
which signals, tracks, and berths make up the section. Since berths can contain
more than one track but only one signal, the map provides a 1-1 mapping from 
signal to berth, and a 1-many mapping from berth to track. 

The map also contains a column named `event`, which represents the fact that a 
train can both enter and vacate a track. This allows for finer control over the 
start and end of the track section. For example, if we wanted to have access to 
the time at which the train entered berth E, we would have to include an 
`'enters'` event for berth E in the map.

The map for the previous example of berths C to E would be as follows:

```{r echo = FALSE}
dplyr::tribble(
  ~signal, ~berth, ~track, ~event,
  "S1", "D", "TD", "enters",
  "S1", "D", "TD", "vacates",
  "S2", "E", "TE", "enters"
)
```

Note that we don't need to include berth C in the map unless we wanted access to
the time at which the train vacated that berth. To process the 7 observations 
derived from the example, this map is sufficient.

This representation of the network map is limited, as it can only handle linear
sections of track, travelling in a single direction. More complex track layouts 
such as junctions are not supported.

With a `raw_centrix` data frame along with the `asset_map`, you can process the
data using:

```{r}
data(raw_centrix, asset_map)
raw_centrix
asset_map
railvarr::wrangle_centrix(raw_centrix, asset_map)
```

You can access these example data sets by running
`data(raw_centrix, asset_map)`. As you can see, the resulting data frame 
contains the timings that we saw earlier:

 * `t_enters`: time the train enters the berth
 * `t_red_on`: time the signal changes to red
 * `t_enters_next`: time the train enters the next berth
 * `t_vacates`: time the train vacates the berth
 * `t_red_off`: time the signal changes from red
 
The `aspect` column gives the signal aspect that the train saw as it entered the
berth. In our previous example, the train saw a green (`G`) aspect as it entered
berth D.

The processed data frame contains calculated durations as well as timings. These 
durations are derived from `TSAR`, which is equal to `t_red_off - t_red_on`. 
`TSAR` stands for 'Time Signal At Red' and represents the amount of time (in 
seconds) that the signal spent on a red aspect. The other durations calculated 
are:

 * `T_onset`: `t_red_on - t_enters` time between train entering berth and 
                    signal changing to red
 * `T_clear`: `t_vacates - t_enters` time taken for train to completely clear
                    the berth
 * `T_offset`: `t_red_off - t_vacates` time between train vacating berth and 
                    signal changing from red
 * `T_travel`: `t_enters_next - t_enters` time taken for train to travel the
                    length of the berth
 * `T_coach`: `t_vacates - t_enters_next` time taken for train to travel its own
                    length

`wrangle_centrix()` also performs data validation, potentially resulting in the 
loss of around 5% of data points. However, this is necessary to ensure that the 
resulting journeys contain valid data. As part of this, the function identifies 
individual train journeys, labeling each train with a unique ID number.

## Clustering

Centrix data contains no information about stopping patterns. However, they can 
be deduced from travel times. As you can see from the following plot, there are 
obvious differences in travel times in the berths which contain stations.

```{r echo = FALSE}
plot_clusters(dplyr::mutate(berth_events, cluster = 1))
```

These differences can be categorised using K-means clustering. This is automated
by the function `cluster_journeys()`. This data set contains 3 distinct groups 
of trains, which can be specified using the `centers` parameter.

```{r}
berth_events_clusters <- cluster_journeys(berth_events,
                                          centers = 3L,
                                          iter.max = 40L)
plot_clusters(berth_events_clusters)
```

Because K-means clustering is a stochastic algorithm, the results of 
`cluster_journeys()` are occasionally not what would be expected. In that case, 
simply run the clustering again. Some trains may also be miscategorised. This 
can be diagnosed visually using `plot_clusters()`, but it is unfortunately a 
manual process to remedy the issue.

# Timetable

`wrangle_timetable()`

# ID Matching

Clustering is a pre-requisite of the ID matching algorithm, which matches 
Centrix data with timetabling information. Timetabling data is necessary for 
calculating delay, and is useful in the analysis of dwell times. It is highly 
recommended that you manually label the clusters found by `cluster_journeys()` 
to match the calling patterns in the timetable.
